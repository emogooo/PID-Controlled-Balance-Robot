# PID-Controlled Balance Robot

This project involves the creation of a balance robot using an Arduino microcontroller and an MPU6050 sensor. The robot utilizes a ***PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative)*** control system to maintain its balance. The ***MPU6050***, a combination of an accelerometer and a gyroscope, provides real-time data on the robot's orientation. This data is processed by the Arduino to adjust the motor speeds, ensuring the robot remains upright. The ***PID algorithm*** is crucial for smooth and accurate balancing, allowing the robot to respond dynamically to changes in its environment. This project demonstrates the application of control theory and sensor integration in robotics.
